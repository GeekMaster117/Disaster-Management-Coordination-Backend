# What is Disaster Management Coordination and how it could be useful

Disaster Coordination is coordination between victims, volunteers, rescue operators and many more involved in the disaster. Disaster Management Coordination is efficiently and reliably managing the coordination between the people involved.

Whenever a disaster happens, many victims face communication issue with volunteers or rescue operators. Victims may not know where to go following a disaster, how to prepare and worse how to act following a disaster. Disaster admins can update the location of refugee camps, allowing victims go to the nearest refugee camp. Our website has many videos on how to prepare and act for various disasters. Altough many websites are already available to know about disasters, our website excels in providing real time updates by leveraging SignalR. Unlike many disaster websites where only government or an organisation will update the information. In our website an admin can add another admin sharing common powers with other admin, building a community.
